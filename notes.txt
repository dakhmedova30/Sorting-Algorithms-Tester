SOTW: Are You Bored Yet? by Wallows

DISCO:
* We did not know that it would take 55 comparisons for Selection Sort, as we traced only 45.
* In Selection Sort, when comparing the same element, the elements are still swapped.

QCC:
* Is there a way to augment Selection Sort to be more efficient?
* If Insertion Sort is the most efficient sort overall out of the three we tested, is there another/other sort method(s) that are even more efficient?

BUB-QA:
* q0: If a pass requires no swaps, what do you know?
* a0: This means that the array is already in increasing order.

* q1: After pass p, what do you know?
* a1: After pass p, we know that all of the p values are sorted.

* q2: How many passes are necessary to completely sort?
* a2: length-1.

SEL-QA:
* q0: How many passes to sort n elements?
* a0: n-1.

* q1: What do you know after pass p?
* a1: The last p elements are in their right place.

* q2: How do you know if sorted?
* a2: n-1 passes were performed.

* q3: What does a pass boil down to?
* a3: A pass is going through the array once and swapping.

INS-QA:
* q0: How many passes to sort n elements?
* a0: n-1.

* q1: What do you know after pass p?
* a1: The first p+1 elements are sorted.

* q2: How will you know when sorted?
* a2: You know it is sorted once all swaps are completed.

* q3: What constitutes a pass?
* a3: The first p+1 elements are sorted through walking the first unsorted element into its right place in the partition.

* q4: What must you track?
* a4: You must track the partition.
